# Even Number Sum Calculator
This Python program calculates the sum of all even numbers up to a user-defined target. The target should be an integer between 0 and 1000.

## How It Works
User Input: The program prompts the user to enter a number between 0 and 1000.
Sum Calculation: The program calculates the sum of all even numbers from 0 up to and including the target number.
Result Display: The total sum is printed to the console.
## Usage
Run the program.
Enter a number between 0 and 1000 when prompted.
The program will output the sum of all even numbers from 0 up to and including the entered number. 
## Notes
Ensure the input number is within the range of 0 to 1000 to get the correct results.
The program uses a step value of 2 in the range function to iterate through even numbers only.
